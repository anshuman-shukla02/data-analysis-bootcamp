### Module 2: Retail Sales Data Analysis using Pandas

This analysis explores a retail sales dataset to derive actionable business insights using Python and Pandas.
Key metrics such as total revenue, category-wise performance, and top-selling products were computed to simulate real-world business intelligence tasks performed by data analysts.

The project demonstrates the ability to translate raw transactional data into meaningful insights, showcasing proficiency in data loading, feature engineering, aggregation, and exploratory analysis—skills essential for data analysis internships and entry-level roles.

### Module 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This module focuses on cleaning and preprocessing real-world retail sales data containing missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data types. A structured cleaning pipeline was implemented using Pandas to prepare the dataset for reliable analysis.

The work highlights practical data wrangling skills including median imputation, categorical normalization, duplicate handling, explicit type casting, and clean dataset generation—core competencies required in data analysis and data science roles.

### Module 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This module explores cleaned retail sales data to uncover revenue drivers, product performance, and regional trends. Aggregations and visualizations are used to convert metrics into actionable business insights.

The work demonstrates the ability to ask business-driven questions, interpret patterns, and communicate insights clearly—core skills for data analysis internships.

### Module 5: SQL for Data Analysis

This module introduces SQL concepts commonly used by data analysts to query structured data. SQL queries are used to answer the same business questions explored with Pandas, reinforcing analytical thinking across tools.

The focus is on translating business requirements into efficient database queries and understanding how SQL complements Python-based analysis in real-world data workflows.

### Module 5: SQL for Data Analysis

In this module, SQL was used to query and analyze structured sales data stored in a relational database. The focus was on translating business questions into efficient SQL queries using filtering, aggregation, logical operators, and joins.

Multi-table analysis was performed by combining sales data with product metadata to answer real-world business questions such as supplier performance, revenue distribution, data quality gaps, and risk concentration. This module reflects industry-standard analytical workflows used by data analysts.
