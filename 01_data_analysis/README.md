### Module 2: Retail Sales Data Analysis using Pandas

This analysis explores a retail sales dataset to derive actionable business insights using Python and Pandas.
Key metrics such as total revenue, category-wise performance, and top-selling products were computed to simulate real-world business intelligence tasks performed by data analysts.

The project demonstrates the ability to translate raw transactional data into meaningful insights, showcasing proficiency in data loading, feature engineering, aggregation, and exploratory analysis—skills essential for data analysis internships and entry-level roles.

### Module 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This module focuses on cleaning and preprocessing real-world retail sales data containing missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data types. A structured cleaning pipeline was implemented using Pandas to prepare the dataset for reliable analysis.

The work highlights practical data wrangling skills including median imputation, categorical normalization, duplicate handling, explicit type casting, and clean dataset generation—core competencies required in data analysis and data science roles.
